# CAF Cook-Off
In our search for the language of the future, we decided to try and write a common dsp function in a few select languages. Which cross ambiguity function implementation will win? Implementations in **Rust**, **Go**, and **Python**.

## OV-1
We are trying to answer the following questions:
* Time required for basic implementation in each language?
* Time required for parralelized implementation (goroutines, threads, async)?
* Throughput performance?
* Cross-compilation?
* How simple is each implementation?

## CAF?
A cross ambiguity function (CAF) is a method of comparing complex waveforms to determine time and frequency offset.

![CAF Surface](/docs/s0s1-caf.png)

## Hypothesis
Teque5 predicts that *go* and *rust* will produce the fastest implementations, but go will have the simplist parralelized version.

## Results
### Benchmarks
Time to compute a 400x8192 cross ambiguity surface using the "filterbank" CAF algorithm. I/O is all float64 and complex128.

Implementation Notes
* go fftw implementation is not saving wisdom smartly. Also data still handled as complex128, but fftw wrapper only supports complex64 so i'm casting in and out during the cross-correlation.
* `numba` uses `@numba.njit` with type hinting.
* rust was not able to crosscompile the nightly bench for `aarch64` (armv8).
* go was not able to crosscompile fftw bindings for `aarch64` (armv8).

### Observations
* Numba is **amazing** and salvages Python's reputation in 2020
* Lack of benchmarking tools in Python sad ðŸ˜¿
* All three languages have excellent tooling
* Go and Python both have complex types, but rust uses a struct with two floats for complex.
* Go has fftw bindings or there is a fft library in go-dsp, but the latter isn't a full implementation and the former has quite a bit of complexity. I am disappointed such a basic tool isn't better integrated. The `go-dsp` implementation only supports `complex128` types, and the `fftw` wrapper only supports `complex64`, which is a real bummer. Additionally the `math` and `math/cmplx` libraries **only** support `complex128`. WHY!

## Code Comparison
Implementations of the frequency shift function.
#### Rust
```rust
fn apply_shift(ray: &[Complex64], freq_shift: f64, samp_rate: u32) -> Vec<Complex64> {
    // apply frequency shift
    let mut ray = ray.to_vec();
    let dt = 1.0 / (samp_rate as f64);
    let exp_common = Complex64::new(0.0, 2.0 * PI * dt * freq_shift);
    for (i, samp) in ray.iter_mut().enumerate() {
        let exp = Complex64::new(i as f64, 0.0) * exp_common;
        *samp *= Complex64::exp(&exp);
    }
    ray
}
```
#### Go
```go
func apply_shift(ray []complex128, freq_shift float64, samp_rate float64) (new_ray []complex128) {
	// apply frequency shift
	precache := complex(0, 2*math.Pi*freq_shift/samp_rate)
	new_ray = make([]complex128, len(ray))
	for idx, val := range ray {
		new_ray[idx] = val * cmplx.Exp(precache*complex(float64(idx), 0))
	}
	return
}
```

def apply_shift(ray: np.ndarray, freq_shift: np.float64, samp_rate: np.float64) -> np.ndarray:
    '''apply frequency shift'''
    precache = 2j * np.pi * freq_shift / samp_rate
    new_ray = np.empty_like(ray)
    for idx, val in enumerate(ray):
        new_ray[idx] = val * np.exp(precache * idx)
    return new_ray
```
