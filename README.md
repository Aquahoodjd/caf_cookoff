# CAF Cook-Off
In our search for the language of the future, we decided to try and write a common dsp function in a few select languages. Which cross ambiguity function implementation will win? Implementations in **Rust**, **Go**, and **Python**.

## OV-1
We are trying to answer the following questions:
* Time required for basic implementation in each language?
* Time required for parralelized implementation (goroutines, threads, async)?
* Throughput performance?
* Cross-compilation?
* How simple is each implementation?

## CAF?
A cross ambiguity function (CAF) is a method of comparing complex waveforms to determine time and frequency offset.

![CAF Surface](/docs/s0s1-caf.png)

## Hypothesis
Teque5 predicts that *go* and *rust* will produce the fastest implementations, but go will have the simplist parralelized version.

## Results
### Benchmarks
Time to compute a 400x8192 cross ambiguity surface using the "filterbank" CAF algorithm. I/O is all float64 and complex128 unless otherwise noted.

Implementation Notes
* go fftw implementation is not saving wisdom smartly. Also data still handled as complex128, but fftw wrapper only supports complex64 so i'm casting in and out during the cross-correlation.
* `numba` uses `@numba.njit` with type hinting.
* rust was not able to crosscompile the nightly bench for `aarch64` (armv8).
* go was not able to crosscompile fftw bindings for `aarch64` (armv8).
* go without goroutines had to explicitly specify GOMAXPROCS=1 on the W-3125 (and only the W-3125).
  Failing to specify a single thread caused weird scheduling, leading to up to *3x slower performance*.
  This is particularly bizzare, as all x86 machines were running Ubuntu 18.04 with the same Go version.
* A multithreaded FFTW implementation was not attempted in Rust. Unlike RustFFT, the FFTW wrapper wasn't
  very explicit about how it handled atomic operations, if at all.

### Observations
* Numba is **amazing** and salvages Python's reputation in 2020
* Lack of benchmarking tools in Python is quite sad ðŸ˜¿
* All three languages have excellent tooling
* Go and Python both have native complex types, but rust relies on a (popular) external library for support.
* Go and Rust MVPs were of comparable complexity
* Both Rust and Go threading are miles ahead of C/C++
* goroutines (green threads) end up being more "plug-and-play" than Rust's std::thread (os threads)
* Go has fftw bindings or there is a fft library in go-dsp, but the latter isn't a full implementation and the former has quite a bit of complexity. I am disappointed such a basic tool isn't better integrated. The `go-dsp` implementation only supports `complex128` types, and the `fftw` wrapper only supports `complex64`, which is a real bummer. Additionally the `math` and `math/cmplx` libraries **only** support `complex128`. WHY!
* The authors of the Rust and Go versions both had rated a 3/10 familiarity with the language before starting. Without
  some initial exposure to core Rust concepts, the MVP for Rust would have taken significantly longer.
